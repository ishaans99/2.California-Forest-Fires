# California-Forest-Fires

Using synthetic data, I analyse time series data regarding forest fires in Bear County, a fictional county in California. Using past annual
data, I estimate the number of acres projected to burn for the next ten years so that the Bear County
Fire Department can allocate resources and plan accordingly. I choose a second-order nonparametric
differencing signal model with an ARMA(1, 2) noise model and forecast that the amount of acres burned
annually is projected to increase by ~50% in the coming years, suggesting an increase in fires in terms of
severity and/or sheer quantity. Please refer to `ProjectReport.pdf` for more details. Code available in `ProjectCode.Rmd` for reference.
